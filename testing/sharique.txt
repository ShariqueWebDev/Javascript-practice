What is JSON?
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format
JSON is plain text written in JavaScript object notation
JSON is used to send data between computers
JSON is language independent *

Why Use JSON?
The JSON format is syntactically similar to the code for creating JavaScript objects. Because of this, a JavaScript program can easily convert JSON data into JavaScript objects.

Since the format is text only, JSON data can easily be sent between computers, and used by any programming language.

JavaScript has a built in function for converting JSON strings into JavaScript objects:

JSON.parse()

JavaScript also has a built in function for converting an object into a JSON string:

JSON.stringify() 

Storing Data
When storing data, the data has to be a certain format, and regardless of where you choose to store it, text is always one of the legal formats.

JSON makes it possible to store JavaScript objects as text.

JSON Syntax Rules
JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript object notation syntax:

Data is in name/value pairs
Data is separated by commas
Curly braces hold objects
Square brackets hold arrays

JSON Data - A Name and a Value
JSON data is written as name/value pairs (aka key/value pairs).

A name/value pair consists of a field name (in double quotes), followed by a colon, followed by a value:

Example
"name":"John"
